TODO:
x Update tests
x move "web" into "sys"
x create simple browser test to make sure it works (create react app probs)
x migrate away from bad json-schema package
x test react-app w/ "browser" and make sure it fails
x look into using "if browser" and having async import happen internally? user would just deal with "sys" package.
- refine dependency graph & user import experience
- remove tracing
- PR description
- bundle READMEs
- document breaking change (PolywrapClient.from(...))
